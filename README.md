## 👨‍💻 About Me
I am a Technical Consultant and Full Stack Developer with experience in system configuration, scripting (PowerShell, SQL, XML), and software integrations. I also develop modern web applications using **React**, **Node.js**, and **PostgreSQL**, both through academic projects and professional work. My engineering background in petroleum and chemical engineering has strengthened my analytical thinking and problem-solving skills, which I apply in programming and software development.  

I am passionate about leveraging programming and technology to improve processes in industries beyond software, combining domain knowledge with technical skills.
